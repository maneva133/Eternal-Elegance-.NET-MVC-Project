            <p>
                As salon owners, we often focus on marketing and unique selling propositions to attract new clients.
                But, there's another crucial aspect that sometimes gets overlooked—what sets us apart when it comes
                to recruiting and retaining a talented team. After all, without a solid team, even the best marketing
                won’t get us far.
            </p>

            <p>Here are the four major factors that every great salon has in common:</p>

            <h3>1. A Phenomenal Culture</h3>
            <p>
                A strong salon culture isn’t about the perks you give, like paid vacations or relaxed dress codes. It’s
                about having healthy, thriving relationships with your team. In a great salon, team members support
                and care for each other, working together toward the salon’s success.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Mike and Gayle Reuling of Air Dry Bar say, “we are there to complete each other, not compete with
                each other.” For salon leaders looking to strengthen their culture, two must-read books are *Radical
                Candor* by Kim Scott and *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team* by Patrick Lencioni.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Opportunities for Growth</h3>
            <p>
                Stylists, like most creative professionals, need opportunities to grow. Without a clear path for
                professional development, team members may eventually move on. The solution? Create a ladder of
                growth or a level system in your salon.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re not sure where to start, consider using salon business coaching firms like Beyond The
                Technique. They can help you develop a system that allows your team to grow within your salon.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Look Good Digitally</h3>
            <p>
                In today’s digital age, having a strong online presence is critical. Stylists are savvy on social media,
                and potential clients will check your salon out online before booking. A well-maintained website,
                strong social media profiles, and positive online reviews are key to showing your salon as modern,
                chic, and desirable.
            </p>

            <p>
                If this isn’t your area of expertise, no worries—there are plenty of marketing professionals ready to
                help. Or, take a page from Ginny Eramo, owner of Interlocks, who brought marketing in-house, saving
                money and allowing for quick pivots.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Be Great Leaders</h3>
            <p>
                Every great salon has great leaders, and it starts at the top. If you want to be a salon where
                everyone wants to work, you need to clearly share your vision, mission, and values with your team.
                Leadership means helping others grow, leading by example, and being accountable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Great leaders may not always hold the title of manager—they are the ones who take initiative, serve
                clients when needed, and foster innovative conversations with the team. If you’re looking for
                leadership development, any book by John C. Maxwell is a great place to start.
            </p>

            <h3>In Summary</h3>
            <p>
                A great salon is built on four pillars: a strong culture, opportunities for growth, a polished digital
                presence, and strong leadership. The most important thing is to be authentic and create a place
                where both your team and your clients feel valued and cared for.
